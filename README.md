# A simple implementation of a graph library for Python using adjacency lists.

##  Features:    
This graph library allows a user to develop an undirected and unweighted graph for any given number of nodes and edges. It allows the nodes and edges to be added individually or through a list for fast creation.<br>
### Some useful methods in this library are: <br>
* The BFS traversal, which returns a list of tuples each demonstrating the order in which they were found.<br>
* The DFS traversal, which is similar to the BFS traversal but does so using a DFS algorithm.<br>
* A path search, which allows the user to find the shortest path between two nodes.<br>
* A shortest paths search, which returns the shortest path from a specific node to every node in the graph that it is capable of visiting.<br>

## Also included:
* An example program that creates a graph using user input by incorporating the graph library.
* A file containing some tests, checking to see if the library methods work as intended.
